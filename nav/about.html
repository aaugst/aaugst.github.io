<!-- Intro Paragraph -->
<h2>My name is Andreya Augst. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information
    Sciences and Technology at Penn State University, with an expected graduation
    date of August 2024. My academic interests include UX/UI design, data
    analytics, and web and software development. 
    <br>
    I am currently seeking an internship opportunity that would allow me to apply 
    my knowledge and learn by working alongside professionals in the field. I am 
    also open to full-time work opportunities, either in person or remote, and I 
    am willing to relocate.
    <br>
    Please do not hesitate to contact me via linkedin or email. Thanks for reading!
